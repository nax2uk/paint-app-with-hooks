#Simple Paint App using React Hooks.

- I started programming this app to learn about react hooks from a scrimba.com tutorial.
- After I completed the tutorial, I refactored the code to add more functionalities.
- I also refactored the code to remove prop drilling and manage state. I did this with two more hooks useContext with useReducer.
As a result, the code is now much cleaner.
